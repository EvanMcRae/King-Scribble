# King Scribble
Play as King Scribble, the benevolent, beloved ruler of the Doodle Kingdom. One tragic day, a twister whisks you away, and now you must traverse tricky terrain through the power of drawing in order to make it back home. The twist: the more you draw, the more you spend your squiggly body mass in the process!

Developed in Unity 2022.3.9f1 for UMBC CMSC493 Capstone Games Group Project (Spring 2025).
