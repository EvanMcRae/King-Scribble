# King Scribble
King Scribble is a 2D puzzle platformer game where you draw the platforms! Play as the titular King Scribble, the benevolent, beloved ruler of the Doodle Kingdom who has been tragically whisked away from his throne by a surprise tornado. Traverse tricky terrain through the power of drawing in order to make it back home to your loyal subjects. The twist: the more platforms you draw into existence, the more of your own scribbly body mass you draw from in the process. The world of this game is split into several short levels—conceived as different pages of a notebook—each with their own unique platforming challenge that you must navigate through resource-efficient drawing to ensure your body stays intact by the end. King Scribble invites players to be both creative and careful as they doodle their way through each level, providing an artful spin on classic puzzle platformer gameplay. This project was produced in the Unity game engine in close collaboration with programmers and artists under limited time, emphasizing the importance of communication and coordination in a team-based game development environment.

Developed in Unity 2022.3.39f1 for UMBC CMSC493 Capstone Games Group Project (Spring 2025).
